## ![][logo] Strukt Bugs

[logo]: ./logo.svg

This is the public bug tracking database for Strukt.  I encourage
everyone to submit and [vote] on issues here, even if you aren't (yet)
a Strukt user.

(You need a GitHub account to file bugs here, but it's free, and
useful.  The GitHub folks are good at maintaining an online bug
database.  I want to spend my time making Strukt better.)


Feel free to use this for:

 - **bugs** you find (I know there must be a few!)

 - **features** you wish it had &mdash; like data sources,
   parsers/generators, output views, or value types

 - **performance** problems &mdash; please include an example of your
   slow pipeline

 - **workflow** issues, where something isn't technically wrong, but
   the design could be improved to operate more smoothly

 - **other** suggestions you have, from the documentation to the color
   scheme

Nothing is off limits.  No part of Strukt is sacred, if there's a
better way.


This isn't design-by-committee, though.  I can't promise that I'll
work on all the issues raised here, or that I'll use the voting to
determine which one to work on first.  I have my own roadmap, and
often one feature is a prerequisite for others, in ways which are not
immediately obvious.


cheers,
